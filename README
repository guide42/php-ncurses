PHP Ncurses
===========

This is an interface for Ncurses PHP extension. Is highly object-oriented by
design and brings new concepts to the ncurses world.

Requirements
------------

The ncurses library and the ncurses PHP extension witch is included in the core
from PHP >= 4.0.7 to PHP < 5.3.0 and from there as a PECL extension.

You can install it runing this (as root)::

    $ pecl install ncurses

And then you need to enable the extension in your *php.ini* by adding::

    extension=ncurses.so

PHPUnit is needed for running the test suite.

Core Concepts
-------------

The core class is ``\Ncurses\Ncurses`` that is needed to be instanced for
everything to work. It contains several methods to be applied to the standard
screen (the whole application) and an unique instance of the event queue.

Usage
-----

    <?php
    
    use Ncurses\Ncurses;
    use Ncurses\Event\Event;
    use Ncurses\Window;
    use Ncurses\Widget;
    
    $ncurses = new Ncurses();
    $window  = new Window(new Rect(0, 0, $ncurses->rows, $ncurses->cols));
    
    $helloWorld = new Widget\Label('Hello World', new Rect(0, 0));
    $helloWorld->rect->center = $window->rect->center;
    $window->widgets->add($helloWorld);
    
    while (true) {
        foreach ($ncurses->events as $event) {
            if ($event->type === Event::TYPE_KEY) {
                if ($event->key === 113) {
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
        
        $window->refresh();
        
        $ncurses->refresh();
        $ncurses->events->process();
    }
